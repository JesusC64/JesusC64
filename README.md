- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Jesus C. and I'm a Computer Science graduate with a bachelors of science from San Diego State University.  Here you'll find many different things I've worked on but primarily what you'll find are projects and tutorials that I've managed to successfully
- build.  You can find out more about what I'm doing on my LinkedIn profile [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesus-chavez-0152101b7/].  You can also message me there if there's any ideas or projects you'd be interested in getting extra eyes/hands on (within reason of course).

- Hope you all enjoy looking at what I've been working on and hope to post more in the future!
